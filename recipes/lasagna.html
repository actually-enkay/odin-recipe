    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.</p>
    <p>Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Meat:</b> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><b>Onion:</b> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><b>Canned Tomatoes:</b> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><b>Fresh Herbs:</b> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlice.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> A dash of sugar balances out of all the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><b>Spices and Seasonings:</b> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, black pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Noodles:</b> This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li><b>Cheese:</b> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li><b>Eggs:</b> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    </ul>
