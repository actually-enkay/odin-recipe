    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chef John's campfire carnitas require some tending and attention while they slow cook in a campfire or in a charcoal grill, but you will be rewarded with the most succulent, tender pork imaginable. Campfire-friendly ways to serve include on tortilla chips, in a bun, or as nachos.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds boneless pork shoulder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt, or 1 teaspoon per pound of meat</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Mexican Oregano</li>
        <li>1 white onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 Fresno chili pepper, seeded and halved, or more to taste</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, skin on</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <o>
        <li>
            Cut pork into 2-inch pieces. Stack 2 (7x10x3-inch) disposable foil baking pans and transfer in the pork. 
            Season with salt, pepper, and oregano, and toss with your hands until everything is evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the pan with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and crimp tightly around the edges. 
            Place on top of another large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and then wrap the foil up over the pan. 
            All seams should be rolled facing up. Repeat with 2 more sheets of aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place pan next to a campfire, or in a charcoal grill, and arrange the burning coals evenly around the pan. 
            Wrap a sheet pan in foil, place over the pan, and arrange some charcoal on top. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a probe or laser thermometer to check the temperature on the surface of the bottom pan, as well as the ambient temperature next to the pan. 
            Try to maintain a constant temperature of between 250 to 300 degrees F (120 to 150 degrees C). To do this, move charcoal further away or closer to the pan as needed. 
            If cooking next to a campfire and the pan is getting more heat from one direction than the other, rotate the pan occasionally. Cook until falling-apart tender, 4 to 5 hours.
